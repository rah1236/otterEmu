# otterEmu

otterEmu is a JavaScript based emulator for the RISC-V Otter CPU, used in CPE 233 and 333 at Cal Poly SLO to teach computer architecture. 

otterEmu is just a winter break boredom project, and is extremely broken, expect nothing to work besides basic instructions at the moment. The end goal is for this to act as a stand in for the Basys-3 development board in order for students and instructors to develop assembly programs and subroutines without needing the hardware. 

## TODO

- Buggy adding in immediates
- Add unsigned instructions (they currently behave as signed instructions)
- Implement interrupts 
- Add LED Display and test
- Add Switches and buttons
- Add viewable and updating memory in HTML
- And so much more!



## Special Thanks

Thanks to Grace, Miles, and Noah for getting me through 233, Dash, Proffesor Callenes-Sloan, and probably most of all Proffesor Mealy for putting together and awesome class, and set of textbooks, and for ultimately giving me a C+ in the course. This Emulator is deserving of about that grade too.
